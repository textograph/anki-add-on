Studies of the prevalence and annual incidence of reactive arthritis are highly heterogeneous with respect to the size of the cohort, collection of data, the definition of reactive arthritis, and the identification of the inducing pathogens. In a US population-based study in Oregon and Minnesota, the incidence of reactive arthritis following documented enteric bacterial infections ranged from 0.6 to 3.1 cases per 100,000, depending upon the organism [11]. An analysis of the data in a 2013 systematic review found that the incidence of reactive arthritis following infection with Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella, was estimated as 9, 12, and 12 per 1,000 patients, respectively [12]. Similarly, the annual incidence of reactive arthritis among children in three pediatric health networks in the United States with Clostridium difficile infection was estimated at 14 per 1000 patients [13]. Globally, the annual incidence has been reported between 0.6 to 27 per 100,000, and the prevalence is estimated to be 30 to 40 per 100,000 adults [3,4,6,14].

                                    Among patients with any of the spondyloarthritis (SpA) variants seen by rheumatologists, those with reactive arthritis are a small minority. This was illustrated by two registry-based studies from Spain in which 1.2 to 1.4 percent of all patients with SpA had been diagnosed with reactive arthritis [15,16].
                                    
                                    Most cases of reactive arthritis appear sporadically, but outbreaks may follow single-source infections. In such outbreaks, the proportion of infected subjects who developed subsequent reactive arthritis has ranged from 0 to 21 percent [6,14].
                                    
                                    The causative pathogens, incidence, and prevalence of reactive arthritis depend upon the geographic region. In general, among the pathogens, Chlamydia is probably the most endemic. It has been estimated that 4 to 8 percent of patients with chlamydial infection develop arthritis [17]. Some of epidemiological studies include cases in which the preceding enterobacterial and Chlamydial infections are silent [18].
